Greengraph :: Documentation
======================================

Greengraph is a basic package that will calculate the number of green-enough pixels in a series of satellite images
between two locations. This can be used as a coarse approximation of land-usage between the two locations.

The core module code was written by
`James Hetherington/and others <https://github.com/UCL/rsd-engineeringcourse/graphs/contributors>`_
at the `Research Software Engineering Course <https://github.com/UCL/rsd-engineeringcourse>`_.
