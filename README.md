Greengraph
==========

Greengraph generates a graph of the porportion of green pixels in a series of satellite images between two points (locations on Earth). As input, it will take in the names of the two locations, along with the number of steps/points to sample inbetween.

The greengraph.py code is taken from the appendix of the MPHYG001 First Continous Assessment pdf file, which in turn comes from https://github.com/UCL/rsd-engineeringcourse/blob/master/ch01data/110Capstone.ipynb
